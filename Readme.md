## Before installation

This implementation makes use of Discord's oauth2, autochess-stats API and a custom database endpoint to retrieve user's Discord's connections, autochess rank and store it in a database.

It is recommended to reimplement the database part. You can find those in ./utilities/db.js.

Set up your bot for [Oauth2](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2).
Fill the .env file.

## Installation

* Reimplement db.js
* Fill .env file
* Install the dependencies and start the server!

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## TODO
* improve display
